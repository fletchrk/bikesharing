# bikesharing
## Overview of Project
The purpose of this project is to convince investors that having a bike-sharing program in Des Moines is a solid business proposal. A bike trip analysis will be provided to the stakeholders. The trip analysis will include 7 different visualizations done in Tableau. The visualizations include a pie chart that shows how many users in New York rented bikes in August 2019 and whether they were subscribers or customers, peak hours in August 2019 that bikes were used, Checkout times for users, trips by weekday per hour, and several other charts that shows you stats by gender.

## Results
### Deliverable 1 Requirements:
Deliverable 1 was done in Jupyter. The data in the “tripduration” column was converted to a datetime datatype and the time format was corrected. The dataframe that was created in Jupyter was then exported as a new csv file that does not include the index column.

### Deliverable 2 Requirements: 
Deliverable 2 was done in Tableau, in which I created 8 different visualizations that utilized the total number of trips, the types of users, the gender of users, and the trip duration columns. The results are below:

•	There was a total of 2,344,224 trips in New York City that was done in August 2019. Of those users, 1,900,359 were subscribers to the company and 443,865 users were customers.
•	The peak hours in August for bike usage was between 1800-1900 hours (6:00pm-7:00pm).
•	The peak number of hours rent bikes for 5-6 hour trips.
•	The majority of individuals who rent bikes are males, while the women users don’t have as large of a peak.
•	The visualizations also show that trips are done on Thursday between 5:00-7:00pm. The trips per weekday(by hour) chart is a great reference to see the peak times of days for that determination.

### Deliverable 3 Requirements:
Deliverable 3 requirement was to build a story out of the visualizations in Tableau. Please click on the link below to view my “NYC Story”

### Summary
After reviewing the data and visualizations that were built in Tableau, I recommend that it would be a good idea to open up a bikeshare business in Des Moines. The interesting outcome that was determined is that Thursday’s are the most popular day to rent a bike in New York. I would think maybe in Des Moines the weekends would be the most popular days to rent bikes. I feel that enough evidence was provided to the stakeholders that there would be a lot of interest in a bikeshare business. I think it would be interesting to do an analysis on colder months to see if the interest is just a spring/summer/fall hobby or if it is a hobby for all year long. The second visualization that I think would be interesting to analyze is if users are using the bikes for work, or to get exercise, or is it to replace using a vehicle.
